# Just a POC

Does not work good out of the box on most diagrams. But you can lead the
agent towards the right answer. I did not test further, but i suppose with
tweaking system prompts, and/or using a better openai model for img reading and
as the parent node you might get better results. Also i think you can make
this work pretty good for specialized diagramms. So if you have a recurring type of diagram, you can exactly instruct the model which pixel lines it has to
analyze and which bounding boxes it has to use. But didn't test.
